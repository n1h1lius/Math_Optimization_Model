# Mathematical Optimization Project

This project is a mathematical optimization algorithm developed in Python. It was created to assist in optimizing work scenarios based on data provided by companies, using specific mathematical formulas.

## Description

The program receives data from CSV files containing information about workers, workplaces, and relationships among them. Based on this data, the algorithm calculates various scenarios based on defined constraints, seeking the most optimal scenario possible from a mathematical perspective.

## Features

- **Modularity**: The code is structured into modules for easier maintainability and scalability.
- **Data Handling**: Ability to read and process data from CSV files.
- **Scenario Optimization**: Calculation of multiple scenarios based on specific constraints.
- **Concrete Results**: Generation of useful mathematical results for decision-making.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
